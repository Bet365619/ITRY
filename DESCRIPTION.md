## Introduction
With the increasingly aging population and a growing segment of vulnerable populations specifically the increasing trend of elderly with no next of kin, Community First Responders (CFRs) must be alerted at the onset of incidents which require emergency response (e.g. cardiac arrests, falls, unattended cooking fires etc.) and mobilise CFRs for effective early intervention. Meaning to deploy the CFRs when an elderly person falls or when an unattended stove becomes a cooking fire. CFRs work closely with SCDF to provide timely relief and response to emergency situations.

With the advancement of technology and transformation of data, effective early interventions can be built in place through the usage of analytical data for better sense-making decisions at the onset of incidents to provide emergency response from CFRs. IOT devices have been developed to collect and transmit data from the device to the cloud for analytics and visualisation.

## Idea of project

Our team has decided to make use of Internet of Things (IOT) devices to collect data, transmit data to the cloud and make use of IBM Watson Studio to analyse and visualise the data to SCDF in order to improve their sense-making to be alerted at the onset of incidents which require emergency response and mobilise the CFRs for effective early intervention for the elderly population.
